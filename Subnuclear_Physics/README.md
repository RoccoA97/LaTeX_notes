## Organization of the repository
The repository is organized as follow:
* **`main`**: it contains the main document with the notes of every lesson;
* **`lessons`**: inside it there are separate folders for each theory lesson. Inside them, there is the following structure:
    * `XX.tex`: source code of the `XX` lesson;
    * `XX.pdf`: pdf of the `XX` lesson, obtained from compiling the `XX.tex` file with pdflatex;
    * `XX_images`: every image of the `XX` lesson, mainly taken from professor's slides;
* **`macro`**: inside it there are useful files for LaTeX packages, new commands and several settings. These are imported in the main document;
* **`frontespizio`**: it contains LaTeX files and images for the titlepage of the main document;
* **`bibliography`**: it contains the LaTeX file for bib items (for citations);
* **`exercise`**: this folder is still incomplete, but the idea is that it will provide a rich collection of exercises useful to deepen the knowledge of the field.



## Topics of the course
The topics treated during the course are:
* introduction and recap;
* detectors for particle physics experiments;
* cross section of electron-positron scattering to muon-antimuon or to hadrons;
* strong interactions, in particular:
    * deep inelastic scattering;
    * the gluons;
    * QCD theory;
    * partons and jets;
* electroweak interactions, in particular:
    * V-A weak theory;
    * gauge theory and symmetry breaking;
    * Cabibbo theory and CKM;
    * CP violation, the B meson system;
* new physics, in particular:
    * neutrino and physics beyond Standard Model;
    * Higgs physics and properties.
